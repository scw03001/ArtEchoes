# ArtEchoes


## Project Overview

This project aims to create a web application with two major functionalities:

### 1. Chatbot System
The main feature of this project is the chatbot system. It allows users to ask various questions about artwork after taking photos of it. For example, if a user captures a self-portrait by Van Gogh, they can inquire about the background of its creation, the techniques he employed, and more. The chatbot will provide detailed answers to enhance the user's understanding of the art.

### 2. Animation Creation
An additional feature of this project is the ability to create animations from paintings. Inspired by the idea that we often imagine paintings in motion, this application will generate desired animations based on user prompts. For instance, a user may prompt the chatbot to animate "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" by Katsushika Hokusai to see the dynamic movement of the wave.
